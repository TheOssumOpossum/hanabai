v0.2: Save criticals... Play Chop!
average_score: 1.4358 max_score: 12

v0.3.0: Save criticals, if there is a player with a one-away clue then repetitively as long as it's a 'good touch', if there are no clues to give, play right-most clued card as long as it could be playable

v0.3.1: Same as 0.3.0 but prefer touching fewer cards.

v0.4.0: Updated GTP from 0.3, clues that touch 0 new cards are no good, prefer touching more cards. This does slightly better than before, note the higher max score.
simulations:10000 average_score:4.9972 max_score:20 strikeout_rate:0.9977 bottomout_rate:0.0023 victory_rate:0.0

v0.4.1: prefer touching fewer cards, this is an improvement over 0.3.0 but significantly far behind 0.3.1 counterpart. The aggressive discarding since clues were spammed lead to fewer bombs and a lower strikeout rate, but at least the max score is higher.

v0.5.0: Added a check for 'clues-left-to-right', prefer touching more cards. Significant improvment to previous version, highest max score!
simulations:10000 average_score:8.6714 max_score:22 strikeout_rate:0.9696 bottomout_rate:0.0304 victory_rate:0.0

v0.5.1: prefer touching fewer cards. Best version yet! This still outperforms the the high touch version since players play left-to-right regardless of their most recent clue.
