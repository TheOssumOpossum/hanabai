# HanabAI

The goal of this project is to generate an algorithm to automatically play Hanabi. This isn't a fancy neural net AI where you won't understand the decision making progress. This AI is a decision tree that tries to emulate how humans play and think about the game.

The motivation is to provide an AI agent that humans can play along with to improve their game and reduce the number of mistakes they make.
